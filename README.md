Description:
Kellogg Buddies is a contact matching site for Kellogg students looking to connect with specific peers who have similar interests. A user submits a preferred interest-parameter and is matched with others who have submitted the same parameter. Users are able to prioritize the parameter they want to be matched over (e.g. target industry) and then get matched with someone who submitted the same answer for this parameter (e.g. "Software").

Instructions:
    1) Start with index.html
    2) Go through sign-in process:
        a) If you're a first-time user, click sign-in with your desired e-mail address
        b) If you're a returning user, sign into your existing account
    3) Once you're signed in, you can do one of two things:
        a) Create a new preference profile by clicking "Submit preferences" and continue with step 4)
        b) If you've already created a preference profile and saved matches that you want to revisit, click "See saved matches" and skip steps 4) and 5)
    4) Select responses to each of the proposed parameters and click "Save preferences". Then, click "See Matches"; if there are other users who have submitted the same interest, they will be proposed as matches.
    5) Click "Save match" for any proposed match that you want to save. These matches will be saved to your saved matches repository.
    6) In "See saved matches", you will see all matches that you have saved.
